        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          This page is a place for me to think out loud. I use it to capture ideas, lessons, and forecasts as we all try to build careers in the age of AI — think long-form “toward data science”–style writing, but without the paywall or the hype.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          I plan to write about a mix of technical topics, including:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Information theory and the connection between machine learning and compression</li>
          <li>Useful tools from projective geometry and statistics</li>
          <li>Practical lessons from programming and building real systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          I also want to document how I’m trying to stay competitive as AI systems evolve: what I think is coming next, what I believe current state-of-the-art models are missing, and how I’m using tools like LLMs effectively today rather than theoretically. This includes how I’m thinking about my own career as the field keeps shifting.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          Beyond the technical side, I’ll occasionally write about people and organizations. Things like what makes teams work, how to disagree productively, and some personal observations about focus, creativity, and the double-edged nature of ADHD — including strategies I’ve found useful for turning it into an advantage in technical work.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-700">
          This section is a work in progress, and that’s kind of the point.
